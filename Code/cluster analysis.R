#Here is what you need to do :
# Compile your data into a single array with dimensions (# of days by # of bins of TAD)  e.g. (4000 x 12) - days in my case is 24hr binnned data for all sharks. Call it X.
# Then compile another array (or individual vectors) with the same number of rows additional  e.g columns: ID , date, sex, lat, long, etc
# the number of bins and length of your data is arbitrary
